  - title: "ChatGPT Coding Tutor: Interactive Learning with Stuctured Debugging Guidance"
    content: "We prototyped a jupyter lab widget using chatgpt to provide hints for programmers debugging for their code. 
    We aim to facilitate a learning environment that encourages users to value iteration, experimentation, 
    and feedback as essential components of the problem-solving process. 
    Our prototype supports learners with functional and performance issues for short, isolated coding problems. 
    We are exploring how to integrate research in cognitive tutoring into offering hints and gamify the learning process.

  - title: "A Semantic Differential Affective and Cognitive Trust Scale"
    content: "As a first step towards designing for AI systems that build appropriate trust through affective and cognitive routes, 
    we seek to develop a set of measures for these two constructs of trust. 
    We created 32 scenarios across 5 dimensions related to human-AI interaction, 
    using factor analysis and regression analysis. After developing the measures, 
    we aim to explore the effect of affect- and cognition-based trust on various 
    behavioral outcomes when people co-creates with generative AI assistants.

  - title: "UXR Internship"
    content: "With the support from designers and ML engineers in the company, 
    I conducted internal research and interview study with data scientists to understand how people approach performance debugging of ML models in the field. 
    Based on the interview findings, I challenged and validated the teamâ€™s internal assumptions, identified needs and difficulties people have with debugging ML models, 
    and proposed ways to redesign and automate features of the product."
