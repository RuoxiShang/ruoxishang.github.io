  - title: "How do people trust their AI assistants cognitively and affectively?"
    content: "As a first step towards designing for AI systems that build appropriate trust through affective and cognitive routes, 
    we seek to develop a set of measures for these two constructs of trust. 
    We created 32 scenarios across 5 dimensions related to human-AI interaction, 
    using factor analysis and regression analysis. After developing the measures, 
    we aim to explore the effect of affect- and cognition-based trust on various 
    behavioral outcomes when people co-creates with generative AI assistants.
