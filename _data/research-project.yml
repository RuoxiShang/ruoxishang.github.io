  - title: "LLMs for Supporting Technical Interviews"
    short-content: "We are exploring how LLMs-powered feedback can facilitate programmers to practice soft skills during a coding interview. "
    content: "This research project leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore provide qualitative feedback in the context of technical interviews. 
    While traditional developer support tools usually focus on technical aspets of programming, we aim to develop a soft skill-focused assistive tool for programmers to effectively communicate their thinking process and articulate their intent. 
    Collecting annotated data from seasoned interviewers, we employ few-shot learning techniques to train LLMs to provide specific, contextual, and actionable feedback that transcends generic advice. 
    The ultimate goal is to create an AI-driven coaching system that mimics expert-level guidance, enhancing the candidate's holistic performance in the competitive tech job market. "

  - title: "Measuring Affective and Cognitive Trust in AI"
    short-content: "We developed and validated a semantic differential scale measuring cognitive and affectivce trust towards AI."
    content: "As a first step towards designing for AI systems that build appropriate trust through affective and cognitive routes, 
    we seek to develop a valid and generalizable set of scales for this 2-dimensional construct of trust. 
    Through a survey over 32 scenarios across 5 dimension and an exploratory factor analysis on the data collected, 
    we established the scale with 27 items and demonstrated its validity. 
    We then conducted another survey study, using the scale to explore a conversational agent's capability to 
    build affective trust when the user is seeking for emotional support."

  - title: "How data scientists diagnose ML models"
    content: "With the support from designers and ML engineers in the company, 
    I conducted internal research and interview study with data scientists to understand how people approach performance debugging of ML models in the field. 
    Based on the interview findings, I challenged and validated the team’s internal assumptions, identified needs and difficulties people have with debugging ML models, 
    and proposed ways to redesign and automate features of the product."

  - title: "Value Sensitive Design for Recommender Systems"
    content: "We adopted value sensitive design approach to explore the research question: 
    How can designers of Recommender Systems adopt a Value-Sensitive approach? 
    We conducted conceptual and technical investigation, analyzing the how everyday recommender systems uphold or violate stateholders’ values. 
    We proposed design recommendations with respect to algorithmic awareness, profiling transparency, and user control."
