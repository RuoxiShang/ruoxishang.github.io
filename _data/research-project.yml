  - title: "GPTutor: Support Interactive Programming Learning with Large Language Models (LLM) and Stuctured Debugging Guidance"
    content: "We prototyped a jupyter lab widget using chatgpt to provide hints for programmers debugging for their code. 
    We aim to facilitate a learning environment that encourages users to value iteration, experimentation, 
    and feedback as essential components of the problem-solving process. 
    Our prototype supports learners with functional and performance issues for short, isolated coding problems. 
    We are exploring how to integrate research in cognitive tutoring into offering hints and gamify the learning process.

  - title: "A Semantic Differential Affective and Cognitive Trust Scale"
    content: "As a first step towards designing for AI systems that build appropriate trust through affective and cognitive routes, 
    we seek to develop a valid and generalizable set of scales for this 2-dimensional construct of trust. 
    Through a survey over 32 scenarios across 5 dimension and an exploratory factor analysis on the data collected, 
    we established the scale with 27 items and demonstrated its validity. 
    We then conducted another survey study, using the scale to explore a conversational agent's capability to 
    build affective trust when the user is seeking for emotional support.

  - title: "How data scientists diagnose ML models"
    content: "With the support from designers and ML engineers in the company, 
    I conducted internal research and interview study with data scientists to understand how people approach performance debugging of ML models in the field. 
    Based on the interview findings, I challenged and validated the team’s internal assumptions, identified needs and difficulties people have with debugging ML models, 
    and proposed ways to redesign and automate features of the product."

  - title: "Value Sensitive Design for Recommender Systems"
    content: "We adopted value sensitive design approach to explore the research question: 
    How can designers of Recommender Systems adopt a Value-Sensitive approach? 
    We conducted conceptual and technical investigation, analyzing the how everyday recommender systems uphold or violate stateholders’ values. 
    We proposed design recommendations with respect to algorithmic awareness, profiling transparency, and user control."
