  - title: "How do people trust their AI assistants cognitively and affectively?"
    content: "
    Study 1: In this work, as a first step towards designing for AI systems that build appropriate trust through affective and cognitive routes, we seek to develop a set of measures for these two constructs of trust. We created 32 scenarios across 5 dimensions related to human-AI interaction, using factor analysis and regression analysis to answer the following research questions:
            - How is affect-based and cognition-based trust perceived differently along the dimensions of human-AI, perceived risk of decision-making, and interaction stage?
            - How do factors such as AI anxiety and technical literacy affect perceived trust towards AI
assistants?

    Study 2: Using design interventions, we aim to explore the effect of affect- and cognition-based trust on various behavioral outcomes when people co-creates with generative AI assistants.
